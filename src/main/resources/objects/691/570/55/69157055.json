    "description": "Sleeveless dress with low scooped back and full skirt. Lace-like appearance created of thousands of interlocking, hinged parts in abstracted floral forms.",
    "justification": "At first glance, the Kinematics Dress looks like a simple black lace cocktail dress. But it is an entirely new approach to apparel design and construction, which deploys a variety of digital technologies to make a flexible, customizable, 3D printed garment. \nFashionable clothing has generally been made from flat textiles, which are painstakingly cut and sewn into 3-dimensional garments. The creation of a Kinematics dress begins by importing one's body metrics into the Kinematics Cloth app. There, clothing designs can be adapted to any body shape using parametric body modelling technology. \nUnlike cloth, 3D printed objects are rigid.  Kinematics provides a system for breaking down complex three-dimensional forms into thousands of individual components that interlock to create a dynamic mechanical structure. Each component is rigid, but integrated hinges connecting the components cause the structure to behave as a pliable plane, fluid enough to be worn comfortably on the body. Also, unlike traditional fabric, this textile can be designed to vary in stiffness, drape, pattern, and opacity across its surface. These elements can be customized using the Kinematics Cloth app. \nMost clothing items are too large to print in a 3D printer. Kinematics Fold is a simulation tool which uses rigid body physics to model the behavior of structures designed in Kinematics Cloth. The tool allows the garment designs to be \u201cfolded\u201d into a printable block. When removed from the printer, the flexible structure unfolds into its three-dimensional form. \nThe Kinematics dress represents a new approach to manufacturing in which design, engineering, customization, and simulation are part of one seamless system, so that the object, once fabricated, is fully finished and complete.",
