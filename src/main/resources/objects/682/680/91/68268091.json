    "justification": "The Nest Learning Thermostat has been called the \u201ciPod of thermostats\u201d\u2014perhaps because its creators, alumni of Apple, were leaders in creating the iPod and early iPhones. The thermostat may do for home energy what the iPod did for portable music-playing: revolutionize it.  The first two generations of the Nest Learning Thermostat were acquired by Cooper-Hewitt in 2013.\n\nThe thermostat features the temperature depicted in bold numbers, front and center, on the large circular face within a simple circular matt stainless steel housing. Functionality is based around a ring.  Moving your finger around the outer ring changes the temperature: the thermostat face turns blue when it is cooling, and red when heating. Pressing the ring provides access to all of the thermostat\u2019s settings.\n\nUsers must initially program the thermostat themselves in the morning, evening, orwhen they are out of the house, but it eventually remembers their patterns and reverts to self-programming. The device can also detect if anyone is in the room, and adjust the temperature accordingly. \n\nBetween October 2010 and October 2012, Nest\u2019s designers sketched with pen and ink in notebooks.  Their sketches, some quick and rough, others detailed and nuanced, document the design process from the early stages of the first generation thermostat to the adjustments of the second generation.  Drawing was used throughout the development process.  As thermostat designer John Filson noted, his sketches \u201care a fast way to capture ideas and work out spatial relationships in a design.\u201d  Filson\u2019s sketches were often done for his own purposes, but were sometimes used to communicate an idea to other engineers.  Filson has pointed out that English is not always the primary language spoken by those in the engineering industry.  \u201cA picture,\u201d he writes, \u201ccan sometimes communicate and idea faster and more effectively than words.\u201d",
