    "justification": "Norman Bel Geddes is a pioneering figure in American industrial design and the Patriot is his most iconic radio design. Created by Geddes for the Emerson Radio & Phonograph Corp., the Patriot made its debut in 1940. Its patriotic appearance, with its red, white, and blue palette, and a rectangular grill reminiscent of the stripes in the American flag, signaled an expression of faith in American technology, industry, and culture at a time when the country was making efforts to recover from the Great Depression while also coping with anxiety about the intensifying war in Europe. \nThe simple rectangular form of the radio case and its minimal decoration\u2014featuring horizontal red and white stripes on the grill, a bold red and white circular station dial above two red control knobs with molded star decoration, and a simple red linear handle\u2014exhibit a modern and pared-down, yet emotive, aesthetic. The Patriot radio shows Geddes at his best, drawing on his background in theatrical design and illustration as well as his commitment to industrial design. In 1925, while in Paris to design to a stage set, Geddes visited the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts (L\u2019Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes). After seeing examples of modern products in that exhibition, Geddes decided to leave theater design for the new discipline of industrial design, convinced that industry would be the driving force of the age. \nThe Patriot not only strives to appear modern, it also takes advantage of new materials and manufacturing technologies of the time, utilizing the versatility of different types of colored plastic in combination with each other: the case is of tough, cast phenolic plastic; the handle and knobs are of durable molded urea plastic; the grill and station dial are of molded cellulose acetate; the transparent dial cover is a sheet of embossed clear acetate.\nThis would be the second example of Geddes' consumer product design to enter the museum\u2019s collection, augmenting the representation of this innovative and influential figure within our American industrial design holdings.",
