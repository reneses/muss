    "justification": "Since its founding in 1901, Herman Miller has sought to promote its brand of modern furniture design through art and illustration.  Over the years, the company has produced posters by such graphic design luminaries as Armin Hoffmann, Stephen Frykholm, John Massey and Don Ervin, that have become as iconic as the products themselves.  \n \nIn 2012, under the direction of Stephen Frykholm, Herman Miller, Inc. solicited proposals from a group of international graphic designers for a limited edition poster campaign that would highlight ten of their iconic products still in production.  Ten posters, produced in a limited edition of ten copies of each, were printed and exhibited in a small traveling show titled THEN x TEN, which showcased the posters alongside reproductions of ten historical posters selected by Frykholm.  The show originated at fortyfivedownstairs, a gallery in Melbourne, Australia in August of 2012, and subsequently traveled to Singapore, Tokyo, and Art Basel Miami.\n \nKam Tang was among the ten image makers who received the commission.  Each designer was encouraged to choose a product, and Tang chose the Aeron chair, designed by William Stumpf (American, 1936 - 2006) and Donald Chadwick (American, b. 1936). Tang felt passionately about the Aeron chair, because he is a committed user of one in his everyday practice.  (He saved up to buy his own after he graduated from college).  For his design, Tang wanted to highlight the unique mesh material that makes up the back and seat of the Aeron chair.  Tang has written that the mesh, called Pellicle, \u201cbroke new ground and I wanted to capture this new dawn\/horizon.\u201d  He sought to \u201cconvey a sense of lightness to communicate the material\u2019s transparency and breathing capabilities.\u201d  To do so, Tang chose to remove the chair from the office environment and showcase it as a landscape.  The poster cleverly showcases the seat of the chair in shimmering gold, with the radiating lines of the mesh seat set against a bold sunset.",

    "label_text": "The Aeron chair was designed by Bill Stumpf and Don Chadwick in 1992, and is ubiquitous in the contemporary workplace. Tang cleverly highlighted the unique mesh used in the chair, called Pellicle, by rendering it in shimmering gold. The striations form radiating lines against a bold sunset, echoing the weightlessness of the mesh.",
