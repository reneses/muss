    "description": "four dimpled plywood sliding panels on top and bottom two sections, the left side with three drawers of black lacquered wood, and metal handles, with lacquered Masonite panels in shades of taupe, beige and grey, the second level with angled braces on the left, and perforated aluminum panel on the right.",
    "justification": "The Eames Storage Unit (ESU) is a system of lightweight, modular storage cabinets and desks constructed of lacquered Masonite panels, laminated birch plywood sliding doors and drawers, perforated aluminum panels, and zinc-plated steel supports. The ESU was part of an effort on the part of Charles and Ray Eames to create economical, inexpensive household furniture using industrial production materials and techniques. In designing this system, the Eameses took their cue from the type of metal shelving found in warehouses and factories. The ESU was composed of standardized, mass-produced, knock-down, interchangeable parts: shelves, drawers, panels, doors, and metal framework and struts. The parts were not only durable but could also be employed to decorative effect through the use of colored panels and textured surfaces, such as \u201cdimpled\u201d plywood doors and perforated metal screens. The variety of available colors and surfaces allowed consumers to customize their units for home and office. The storage units came in various sizes that could also be stacked for use as room dividers.\nThe concept and forms of the ESU relate to both the Eameses\u2019 own \u201ccase study\u201d home, which was built with modular, off-the-shelf industrial elements, and the Eameses\u2019 earlier wooden Case Goods furniture (ca. 1945). The ESU, first produced in 1950, made no attempt to hide the standardized industrial look of its components. The units were available in single and double widths\u2014in the 100  (one unit high), 200 (two units high) and 400 (four units high)\u2014as well as in smaller cabinets and desks. These pieces are an exercise in formal geometric design and exemplify the simplicity and integrity of material characteristic of the Eameses\u2019 work. \nThe model proposed for acquisition, with its angled steel legs, is a example from the first series of units. This type of leg was later replaced with a sturdier but slightly inset leg that included triangular supports, beginning around 1952. Production of the ESU ceased in 1955. The shades of taupe, gray, beige, and ivory used in this example reflect the palette of natural tones popular in progressive interiors of the early 1950s. Made to mix and match, the resulting ESUs reflected their purchasers\u2019 tastes. \nThe Eameses, whose seminal work has been the subject of exhibitions at Cooper-Hewitt and other museums, are major 20th-century American designers whose careers the museum would like to represent in depth through a broad range of materials and forms. This would be the first example of the Eameses\u2019 case furniture to enter the collection, and would join a strong and varied range of their seating designs.",
