    "description": "Three registers. Upper register: a horizontal plane in black and yellow stripes sandwiched by gray panels and supported by two pink legs; middle register: striped black panel supported by outlined panel and two outlined legs; lower register: two overlapping striped black panels sandwiching a gray panel supported by two legs and an abstract construct of a pink rectangle, jutting diagonally, supported by a yellow triangle and a blue arc.",
    "justification": "This is one of two sheets of designs for tables by Michele De Lucchi that date from the founding year of Memphis, the highly influential design collective led by Ettore Sottsass. Members of the collective included De Lucchi, Nathalie du Pasquier, Matteo Thun, and Marco Zanini. The Memphis group, which coalesced in response to the predominant modernist aesthetic, caused a sensation with their fun product designs and architecture in flamboyant colors and richly patterned surfaces\u2014a striking contrast to the cool elegance of modernist design. \nThe designs on these two sheets explore some playful ideas for a table. Instead of a traditional base, the table uses a leaning single column base buttressed by a stabilizing arc-shaped support. The black-and-white striped table top can be found in other products designed by De Lucchi for Memphis, such as the Oceanic Table Lamp and the Flamingo Side Table. The base motif appears to have inspired a tea kettle designed by Matteo Thun a few years later.\nThese De Lucchi drawings would not only enhance the museum\u2019s collection of drawings by 20th- and 21st-century designers, but would also serve as documentation of the Memphis group\u2019s early design activity.",
