    "description": "Four shelf designs. From left to right, the squares of the shelves progressively get smaller. First from left: large grid shelving unit; second: two roughly overlapping grid shelving units making the squares smaller, with books, a potted plant, a frame; third:  two roughly overlapping grid shelving units making the squares even smaller, with an alarm clock, a frame, and books; fourth: two grid shelving units completely overlap each other with all previously-noted objects.",
    "justification": "This drawing is a preparatory work for the design of the Scatter Shelf, a storage unit designed by the Japanese studio, Nendo. The piece is composed of 5mm glossy black acrylic shelves that have been arranged as a grid and stacked in three\u2014slightly off-kilter\u2014layers. This creates a kaleidoscopic visual effect, in which the individual shelves appear to increase and decrease in volume depending on the viewer\u2019s vantage point. Nendo\u2019s founder, Oki Sato, has referred to the experience of this effect as appearing to be \u201ccaught in a spider\u2019s web.\u201d[1] \nSato executed this drawing in preparation for the exhibition of a group of 35 Scatter Shelves at Friedman Benda Gallery in New York City. The drawing was reproduced on the wall at the entrance to the exhibition. With its simple ink lines, the drawing lyrically depicts the layering of the grid structures to form the complete shelving unit.\n[1] \"Nendo: Scatter Shelf,\" Friedman Benda, http:\/\/www.friedmanbenda.com\/exhibitions\/nendo-scatter-shelf",
