    "justification": "The Blenko Glass Company represents the combination of technological advances in glassmaking with original designs noted for their focus on color, a key element of the glassware\u2019s impact. \nBlenko originally produced flat glass for windows, including stained glass for the windows of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York City. The company earned national recognition, especially for the creation of a strong ruby red glass that could be double fired. Red, a notoriously fugitive color in glass, was generally unstable could not be fired a second time. Blenko\u2019s glass could be double fired without loss of color, which enabled enamel decorators to paint on it. William Blenko, the company\u2019s founder, patented the formula in 1924, ensuring its popularity with enamellers. The subsequent decision to launch a glass tableware line meant this color entered a field previously reserved for ceramics.\nBlenko\u2019s first tableware catalogue appeared in 1929, and precipitated patronage by major department stores. Some of Blenko\u2019s early pieces emulated Venetian glass with irregular shapes and textures to emphasize the handmade elements. Blenko explored how handmade craftsmanship and modern lifestyle could coexist in a design idiom. As a testament to the popularity of Blenko\u2019s early tableware, the White House acquired a collection.\nAlthough the work of the company\u2019s first designers achieved much critical acclaim, the designers were largely uncredited until Blenko hired company\u2019s first design director, Winslow Anderson, in 1947. The role of design director was progressive for its time, as it was unusual to have a full time in-house position providing overall design direction to a firm\u2019s output. Subsequent design directors, Wayne Husted, Joel Philip Myers, and John Nickerson, were all involved in the Studio Glass movement, as innovators or practitioners. \nBlenko\u2019s production represents a major story of the American handmade glass industry. At its peak, more than 50 glass companies thrived in the industry\u2019s base of West Virginia. After the industry\u2019s decline, there are now only a few firms that create handmade antique glass. \nThis vase was one of 50 works selected for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s 1950 exhibition, 20th Century Glass, American and European. It represented one of the few American companies, along with Louis Comfort Tiffany, to be shown on par with European counterparts such as \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9 and Orrefors. The vase is listed in a Blenko catalog (ca. 1940) as part of the Heavy Swedish type series. It is the only object in this series with an applied coil and was almost certainly the design of Carl Ebert Erickson, the foreman and de facto chief designer of Blenko into World War II. Erickson had worked at the Pairpoint glass factory prior to Blenko and came from a line of Swedish glassmakers: both his father and grandfather were master blowers at the Reijmyre glassworks in Sweden. Erickson left Blenko to found his own company, Erickson Glassworks, in Ohio, which spurred Blenko to create the new position of design director, filled by Anderson.\nThis piece is part of a larger gift of Blenko glass proposed for acquisition. This proposed gift is from the collection of Damon Crain, one of the leading authorities on Blenko glass, and includes significant objects that tell the story of firm\u2019s ingenuity and work of the firm\u2019s designers, known for their use of hard-to-produce color and innovative forms. This is a rare opportunity to acquire not only the history of an innovative firm, but works by designers of significance in their own right. At the time of proposed acquisition, two of the designers represented, Wayne Husted and John Nickerson, are still active and successful Studio Glass designers. This gift represents a distinguished history of the firm not previously represented in the museum\u2019s collection and also strengthens the museum\u2019s holdings of American glass from 1930 to 1980.",
