    "gallery_text": "Introduced in 1968, the \u201cPronged Vaccinating and Testing Needle\u201d (US Patent 3,194,237) was a small innovation that dramatically assisted the global eradica\u00action effort of smallpox. The simple tine design was the brainchild of microbiologist Benjamin Rubin of Wyeth Laboratories in collaboration with engineer Gus Chakros. The two men adapted a sewing-machine needle by grinding it into a double-pronged fork shape. Capillary action held liquid within the tiny split in an amount sufficient for successive jabs and effective inoculation on the skin\u2019s surface. Skin is ideal because it contains antigen cells from the immune system. The bifurcated needle decreased the waste of inoculate by as much as 50 percent and provided accurate, consistent dos\u00acage and puncture efficiency. Vaccinators did not require extensive training, nor were complicated field techniques necessary\u2014the tines of the slim steel needles held the exact dosage. Batch-cleaned and steril\u00acized, needles could be used over and over again.",
    "label_text": "Administering the smallpox vaccine required only a shallow injection into the skin, which contains cells from the immune system. After centuries of attempts to perfect a delivery system, the two-pronged needle was introduced in 1968. An adaptation of a sewing-machine needle, it provided accurate dosage, puncture efficiency, and ease of use.",
