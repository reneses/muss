    "gallery_text": "Powers of Ten (1977) is a short film written and directed by the designers Charles and Ray Eames. An adaptation of Kees Boeke\u2019s 1957 book Cosmic View, the nine-minute film depicts the relative scale of the universe in power of ten. Powers of Ten promotes a type of rich, interdisciplinary thought that approaches ideas from multiple interrelated perspectives, ranging from the infinitesimal to the cosmic, as well as the orders of magnitude in between. Beginning a mythical journey into space with a lakeside picnic in Chicago as its starting point, the film transports viewers to the outer edges of the universe by increasing the distance from earth ten times every ten seconds. Returning to earth with breathtaking speed, the film then pictures a voyage into the human body, ending inside a carbon atom in the hand of a man sleeping at the picnic.",
    "label_text": "This iconic film illustrates scale of observation and thought. Beginning at a lakeside picnic in Chicago, the viewer travels to the universe and back, then into the microstructure of the human body. Charles and Ray Eames made this adaptation of Kees Boeke\u2019s 1957 book, Cosmic View, to celebrate the power of scale in shaping our understanding of the world.",
