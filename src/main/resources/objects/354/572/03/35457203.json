    "gallery_text": "Throughout the ancient Near East, cylinder seals, made of stone, metal, or glass, were tools for marking property. Generally, the cylinder was rolled over damp or semi-hardened clay or wax, leaving a legible inscription; the piece of clay or wax was affixed to an object or sealed a door. The design on the seal was carved in recess with a flint point; different local contexts and eras produced carvings of varying quality. Records indicate both men and women in Babylon possessed at least one seal, worn as a pendant.. The Old Babylonian cuneiform inscription on this example identifies the owner of the seal as a certain Belshunu. Flanking the inscription on the cylinder seal are two figures on either side, a nude female and a horned, turban-wearing warrior god, that is, the deities Shala and Adad, as well as two other figures in long robes, probably worshippers of their cults.",
