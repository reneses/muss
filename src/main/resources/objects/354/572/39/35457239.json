    "gallery_text": "This ornate canoe prow, tauihu, is a power object. Most likely from a war or fishing canoe, it is a symbolic social force laden with symbolism meant to impress onlookers and embolden users. Canoes, waka, were some of the most important possessions of Maori chiefs, who were concerned with their lineage and their ancestors\u2019 original migrations from central Polynesia. This prow belonged to Chief KiwiKiwi from the Bay of Islands, on New Zealand\u2019s North Island. Carved canoe prows feature a stylized long-necked head projecting forward with tattooed facial designs and a protruding tongue. The aggressive figure at the prow was believed to part the seas, the domain of the god Tangaroa. The figures and spirals, part of the complex symbolism of the Maori, are found across a variety of wood carvings. Wood was worked with stone tools and a mallet of wood or whalebone and carried out under ritual restrictions.",
