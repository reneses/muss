    "description": "Clear acrylic rectangular box, partially open on the top, with an L-shaped handle at the same end.  At the opposite end, on the bottom, a narrow open slit the full width of the box. With white tape and multicolor ink splatters.",
    "justification": "The drag box, which is integral to the creation of many Tillett designs, was originally invented by Leslie\u2019s father, George Tillett, in 1942 or 43. The elder Tillett lined up the boxes on a tilting carriage to create a striping machine, as continuous vertical stripes could not be printed using the flatbed screen-printing process. Leslie began experimenting with a loose box, which enabled him to do many other things besides simple stripes: color bands could be overlapped to create darker stripes of various widths, or the lines could be curving or horizontal.  \nThe drag box is a simple rectangle of Lucite which contains the color. The ink is released through a narrow open slot at one end, and is cleaned off by a blade just above the slot. The angle and speed at which the box is pulled across the surface determines the amount of ink released.",
