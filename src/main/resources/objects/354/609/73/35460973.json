    "description": "Printed textile design with hollyhocks in foreground, a \"C\"-shaped honeysuckle vine curving around the hollyhocks from lower right to upper left, and  a meandering abstract design in monochrome in the background.",
    "justification": "Although textile designs were not a major part of his graphic production, Alphonse Mucha produced a number of designs for printed fabrics between 1897 and 1898 (as recorded in the artist\u2019s diaries). All of these were handled by the firm of Carl Gustave Forrer, an industrial draftsman of Swiss origin who had established businesses in Paris and the Parisian suburb of Sannois. The Forrer firm sent the designs to an Alsatian printing firm, Sheurer, Lauth & Cie, and possibly to a London shop for manufacture. \nIt is not clear how many of Mucha\u2019s designs were actually produced or how they were used. Comparatively few printed textiles are known today. Examples may be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Landesmuseum W\u00fcrttemberg in Stuttgart, and in the collection of Cooper-Hewitt.\nIn describing Mucha\u2019s textile designs, the designer Maurice Pillard Verneuil said that Mucha\u2019s \u201csystem of composition is two-part in the sense that in the same design, he combines a very stylized design with one very close to nature. A very naturalistic floral design occupies the first plane and in the background, a simple stylized form completes the ensemble.\u201d[1] This comment aptly applies to the design proposed for acquisition.\nThe proposed drawing would join other textile designs by Mucha in the museum\u2019s collection, including Femme \u00e0 Marguerite and Anemones, Apple Blossoms and Narcissi\u2014both of which share similar characteristics of color and composition.\n[1] Maurice Pillard Verneuil, \u201cAdaptation du D\u00e9cor \u00e0 la Forme,\u201d Art et D\u00e9coration: Revue Mensuelle d\u2019Art Moderne, December 1903.",
