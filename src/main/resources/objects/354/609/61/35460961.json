    "justification": "Color and original design are two key components of Blenko glass. The firm had five important designer directors, of which Wayne Husted was the second. Husted introduced Blenko to the concepts of Studio Glass before it became a movement. His abstracted forms and experimentation with color make him a key figure in the history of the firm. \nThis decanter with stopper was only sold for one year, 1957, in this color, Nile green. The piece embodies the more flamboyant design elements of the late 1950s. These decanters were marketed as functional objects in Blenko\u2019s catalog and many were purchased with use in mind. For Husted, however, it is clear that he was primarily interested in the object as a sculptural, richly colored form for display, bringing a mix of art and design to Blenko\u2019s portfolio. The fact that the Blenko mark is sandblasted, a labor-intensive process, rather than acid etched, is another indication of the handwork that set Blenko apart from the mass market glass that was designed and produced in the United States during the same period.\nThe decanter proposed for acquisition would help tell the full design story of this firm and also represents top-level work by Husted, one of the most important designers to direct the Blenko firm.",
