    "gallery_text": "In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, ascertaining the solar system\u2019s size was seemingly impossible. Relative distance of each planet from the Sun was known, but not actual distance. The most promising solution involved measuring the \"Transit of Venus\"\u2014the passage of the planet Venus across the Sun\u2019s face. Plans called for observers at two different points to register the time transit began. The two would therefore record slightly different times. In theory, knowing that time difference and distance between locations would make it possible to calculate distance to the Sun. However, these measurements were almost impossible to make. In 1874 the U.S. government sent eight expeditions to observe the transit, stationing them across the globe with identical equipment, including eight of these telescopes, made by the American telescope maker Alvan Clark. Although not completely successful, the expeditions were a bold assertion that American science and scientific-instrument making had come of age.",
    "label_text": "In the nineteenth century, scientists thought Earth\u2019s distance from the Sun could be ascertained by measuring the transit of the planet Venus across the Sun, an event that occurs once every 120 years. The United States sent eight international expeditions equipped with specially designed telescopes (this one went to Australia). Although not completely successful, the expeditions asserted that American science had come of age.",
