    "gallery_text": "Among the first commercially successful mechanical writing devices was the \"writing ball,\" invented by Rasmus Malling-Hansen, a Danish teacher of the deaf, who wanted to provide a mechanical means of communication for the deaf and mute. In 1870, he patented a working model of the machine in Europe and received the first of three U.S. patents in 1872. The application for his \"Type Writing-Machine\" (US Patent 125,952), detailed how type-carrying plungers made an imprint on a paper wrapped on a cylinder. Controlled by a pendulum or electricity, the machine\u2019s spring-driven mechanism rotated the cylinder line by line and letter by letter. He suggested that the \"types\"\u2014today called \"keys\"\u2014should be arranged in two clusters, vowels for the left hand, consonants for the right., Early adopters like German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche had embraced the writing ball long before businesses made typewriters viable on a mass scale.",
    "label_text": "This \"writing ball\" was one of the first commercially successful typewriters. The layout of its keyboard was based on the frequency of letters used, coupled with the position of the fastest-typing fingers. Enabling users to write faster than one could by hand, the typewriter became especially popular in business offices during the late nineteenth century, with the increasing demands for paperwork.",
