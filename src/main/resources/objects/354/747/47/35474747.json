    "description": "One scene from the twelve which illustrate the story of Cupid and Psyche. This scene, containing three panels, shows a kneeling Psyche offering a goblet to a seated Venus. Cupid, leaning on his bow, stands on a pedestal in the background. The figures are within an Empire-style interior, with marble-tiled walls, columns, fountains, coffered ceiling and parquet floor. The entire scene is printed in grisaille, or shades of gray.",
    "justification": "Most scenic papers were designed to be continuous, with the first panel lining up with the last to create a seamless landscape. Les Amours de Psyche (The Loves of Psyche), however, was designed to be hung in sections, with each scene surrounded by borders. The full set contains 26 panels depicting 12 different scenes that range in width from one to four panels. The full set required 1,245 wood blocks to print.\n \nIn the tale of Cupid and Psyche, which dates back to the 2nd century AD, Psyche\u2019s great beauty causes Venus to be jealous. Venus instructs her son, Cupid, to make Psyche fall in love with a hideous monster. Startled by her great beauty, Cupid accidently pricks himself with an arrow and falls in love with Psyche instead. Under the care of Cupid, Psyche is carried off to a palace and waited on by invisible servants. Cupid tells Psyche he can only visit at night and she must never try to see him. Psyche\u2019s jealous sisters convince her that Cupid is a monster whom she must kill. Psyche\u2019s distrust causes Cupid to flee, taking the palace with him. Out of desperation, Psyche approaches Venus for help. Venus instructs Psyche to perform a set of tasks in order to be reunited with Cupid. \nThis scene shows a kneeling Psyche offering Venus a goblet of water from the fountain of youth. This was the last feat Psyche was asked to perform by Venus. Upon its successful completion, Psyche was transformed into a goddess, allowed to marry Cupid, and the two lived happily ever after. The scene is set within a severe Empire-style interior with marble-tiled walls, columns, fountains, and a coffered ceiling. The figures are all dressed in classical costume.\nDesigned by Merry-Joseph Blondel and first printed by the French firm Joseph Dufour et Cie in 1816, Les Amours de Psyche was considered the firm\u2019s masterpiece. After Joseph Dufour\u2019s death, the woodblocks were sold to Desfosse & Karth, who printed five more editions until 1931. The blocks were badly damaged during World War II; no sets have been printed since.\nThis example is an early printing on joined sheets of handmade paper, which dates it to about 1820. The first scenic wallpaper was not printed on continuous machine-made paper until 1830. Although French manufacturers began making continuous lengths of paper by machine in the 1820s, many felt that the joined sheets of handmade paper were of better quality than those made by machine. \nThe museum\u2019s collection includes two original drawings by Blondel from 1815 for the Les Amours de Psyche scenic paper. One of the drawings is related to the proposed scene, while the other is for the Reconciliation of Venus and Psyche. Although the museum\u2019s collection also includes a full set of this scenic paper, printed in 1923, only one scene from the set has been fully conserved and is exhibitable. Acquiring this piece would be a wonderful addition to the collection, as it is an early printing and would also allow the museum to exhibit an alternate scene from the set.",
