    "description": "Linear form, reminiscent of a construction crane, composed of a horizontal arm containing an LED array on one end, mounted via a roller mechanism on a vertical post surmounting a circular red base. Horizontal arm can move along three axes: up\/down, back\/forth, and rotationally. Vertical, red counter-balance mounted on back of vertical post.",
    "justification": "Jake Dyson developed the CSYS (pronounced \u201cc-sis\u201d) lamp over a period of about two years. He was motivated by a desire to take advantage of the energy efficiency and sustainability of the latest light-emitting diode (LED) technology and to satisfy the need for a task lamp that would move smoothly and stay put once it was positioned. \nThe lamp\u2019s key feature is an innovative thermal management system designed to cool the hot LED chips through the use of heat pipe technology, a system originally employed for cooling satellite electronics and microprocessors. LEDs last longer when kept at cooler temperatures. Dyson has cooled the CSYS LED chips significantly, increasing their lifespan to 160,000 hours (37 years), compared with about 50,000-hours for standard LED lamps and the 5,000\u201310,000-hour lifetime of compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs. In addition to its energy efficiency, the lamp\u2019s LEDs are additionally environmentally-friendly as they do not contain the mercury present in fluorescent bulbs. \nAnother innovative feature of the CSYS is its simple yet highly functional form. Dyson took his inspiration for the lamp\u2019s linear body and movement mechanism from three sources: the basic form of a construction crane, an elevator mechanism, and a drawing board grid. The lamp consists of a simple horizontal arm, containing the LED chips and heat pipe, connected to a vertical support via a roller system with counterweight for smooth movement, and a simple circular base with dimmer. The lamp\u2019s name, CSYS, is derived from the mathematical system of coordinates that defines an object\u2019s position on the X, Y, Z axes on a graph; the name CSYS acknowledges the three axes on which the horizontal arm moves: up\/down, back\/forth, and rotationally. Unlike many earlier task lamps, which move via imprecise hinge or spring mechanisms that can stretch and loosen as they age, the CSYS arm moves smoothly and consistently and remains in place once the user has positioned it.\nThe CSYS task light also provides more ergonomic lighting. Dyson designed the LED light source to cast an even, warm light with good color\u2014a key improvement upon earlier harsh, blue-tinted LED lights and yellow-tinted CFL light bulbs. \nGiven the rapid changes in today\u2019s LED technology, as well as concern for energy use and sustainability, the CSYS lamp would be a fine addition to the examples of LED lighting currently in the collection. It would also expand the museum\u2019s group of task lights, the earliest of which dates from about 1930.",
