    "justification": "The austere architectonic form of this vase embodies many of the modernist ideas espoused by Keith Murray. These included reliance on form, the use of geometric rather than organic shapes, and simple decoration (if decoration was used at all). Modernist design was, in part, intended as a practical, democratic means of meeting the needs of society and improving life for all through the use of mass production for well designed, widely available, and inexpensive goods. Like other architects and designers working in this style, Murray strove to create pieces that rejected the idea of decoration for decoration\u2019s sake and that emphasized the idea of \u201cform follows function.\u201d\nWedgwood, established in 1759 by Josiah Wedgwood, was famous for its highly decorative traditional ceramic wares. The company commissioned pieces by well-known artists. In 1932, Wedgwood hired Murray to create a modern line to spur the firm\u2019s business by appealing to a growing middle class that was increasingly interested in design. Although Murray\u2019s modernist designs reflected the precision of machine production, his early vessel forms required throwing and turning by hand. A number of his later forms were suitable for manufacture by the slip casting method and, as such, were less expensive to produce. \nThe simple form of the blue-green globular vase, and its regular horizontal ridges, looks like a celebration of machine production. The matte glaze, developed in late 1932 to early 1933, has a muted eggshell-like sheen and further accentuates Murray\u2019s pure form. His work contrasts greatly with contemporary art deco ceramics, such as those by Clarice Cliff, which were highly decorative and often used intensely-colored glazes applied in wild geometric patterns.\nThis vase is being offered together with another Murray vase as a gift. The pair would strengthen the museum\u2019s international and modernist holdings. These vases broaden the museum\u2019s collection of modernist ceramics while adding depth to its holdings of 20th-century English ceramics, which include a bowl and inkwell by Murray.",
