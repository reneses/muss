    "justification": "For the 10th anniversary of their design firm Non-Format, Kjell Ekhorn and Jon Forss self-published a limited edition set of posters celebrating the work of music icon, David Bowie. The project was inspired by a text written by one of Bowie\u2019s famed record producers, Brian Eno. The piece, titled \u201cAxis Thinking\u201d and published in his 1996 book, A Year with Swollen Appendices, Eno argues that by looking at something on a spectrum of two extremes\u2014an axis\u2014one can find undiscovered areas within an already familiar creative endeavor. \nFor Eno, axis thinking was a method that could be used in the music studio. Non-Format utilized axis thinking to retrospectively examine the musical output of David Bowie. They categorized each of David Bowie\u2019s albums against idiosyncratic and arbitrary extremes. The album Scary Monsters, in their estimation, was more \u201cBridge\u201d than \u201cTunnel\u201d and more \u201cScissors\u201d than \u201cRock,\u201d while the album Station to Station was more \u201cFight\u201d than \u201cFlight\u201d and more \u201cHeart\u201d than \u201cHead.\u201d To visually communicate these classifications, Non-Format used icons of mixers and sliders (echoing the equipment Eno might have used in the recording studio) to \u201cdescribe each Bowie album within Non-Format\u2019s own framework of extremes.\u201d The project resulted in two posters representing Bowie\u2019s musical albums. The first covers the years 1969\u201375 and is printed in gold on black paper. This poster is the second, which encompasses the years 1976\u201384 and is printed in silver on black paper. The posters were featured in the Communication Arts 2011 Design Annual.\nThis work is part of a larger gift proposed for acquisition from Non-Format. The gift in its entirety would offer an overview of the firm\u2019s work from 2006 to 2010, allowing the museum to showcase their evolving practice. An impression of this poster was included in the 2011 exhibition, Graphic Design: Now in Production.",
