    "description": "Circular form recalling an Elizabethan ruff collar, executed in electroform silver.  Necklace tapers in from the top and bottom, forming a \"V\" and meeting at a point in the center.",
    "justification": "This necklace, from the personal collection of jewelry designer and metalsmith Chunghi Choo, is an important example of an innovative use of technology in an elegant design. With an intricate yet fluid composition, the necklace combines modern design practice with an aesthetic that harks back to the 16th and 17th centuries in its resemblance to Elizabethan ruff collars, which were stiff in appearance and made of various fabrics. Although made from electroformed silver, it mimics the curves and volume of a fabric piece. \nThis piece uses electroforming in an innovative way that is rarely seen in jewelry production. Electroforming is similar to electroplating in that it deposits thin layers of metal on a form using an electric current. In electroforming, however, the plating is thicker and the form is removed afterwards, resulting in a self-supporting structure that enables a finer and more complex replication of the original form. This necklace reveals the advantages of using this mechanical process in jewelry making: its continuous curves and bends would have been nearly impossible to create through traditional methods. \nThis piece represents an important combination of innovation and technology in 21st-century jewelry design and would be the first piece by the Korean designer, Sung-Ran Kim, to enter the collection. The acquisition of this necklace would also be an exciting opportunity for the museum to augment its contemporary jewelry collection with a noteworthy piece valued by a significant designer; the museum\u2019s collection includes a sophisticated silver teapot designed by Choo.",
