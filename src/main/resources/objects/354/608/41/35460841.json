    "description": "Poster depicting the buildings of the Le Havre in blue, yellow and red.  Each letter in the words \"Le Havre\" and \"Patrimoine mondial de l\u2019humanit\u00e9 is arranged to correspond to windows in the buildings.",
    "justification": "During World War II, the French city of Le Havre was severely bombed. Auguste Perret, a pioneering French modernist architect, was tasked with rebuilding the city. Perret\u2019s reconstruction is considered exceptional for its seamless integration of the city\u2019s extant historic structures with modern concrete construction and design innovations. Perret\u2019s new buildings for Le Havre were conceived of within a 6.24-meter-square modular system. \n \nPhilippe Apeloig designed this poster in 2006 to commemorate the UNESCO designation of the French city of Le Havre as a World Heritage Site. His design takes Le Havre\u2019s innovative architecture as its subject and Perret\u2019s conception of the city as a Gesamtkunstwerk as its framework. Graphic renditions of the standardized facades of three of Perret\u2019s buildings are laid atop one another, each in a different primary color. The areas where the different buildings overlap generate secondary colors, while the text forms echo the windows in which they appear to sit. Apeloig\u2019s poster evokes the harmony of the modular system employed by Perret.",
