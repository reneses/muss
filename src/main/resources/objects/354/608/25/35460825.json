    "description": "Form composed of simple square frame that accommodates a 6th generation Apple iPod to snap in when being used as watch face and snap out when used as a media player; simple black silicone rubber strap with metal buckle.",
    "justification": "In 2010, when the minimal, square sixth-generation iPod Nano media player was introduced, product designer Scott Wilson was inspired to create the TikTok and LunaTik watch conversion kits that would take advantage of the Nano\u2019s large face, turning the device into a multi-touch wristwatch. The kits were intended as a creative and affordable way to transform the media player into a convenient time keeping device. \nThe TikTok is a watchband with a simple snap-in design that allows its user to easily and quickly insert a Nano, changing it from clip on device to wristwatch. Snap the Nano out of the case, and you again have your clip-on media player. The TikTok watch housing is molded from reinforced PC\/ABS plastic. The LunaTik kit has a heavier, two-part aluminum housing with mounts for users who choose to wear the Nano exclusively on their wrists. Wilson\u2019s goal was to \u201c...create a collection that was well designed...Not just clipped on a cheap strap as an afterthought.\u201d[1] Both kits feature straps of compression molded high-grade silicone rubber with an anti-dust coating and stainless steel hardware.\nWilson approached Apple and other potential manufacturers with his idea, but they declined, thinking his products too expensive lacking mass appeal. Undaunted, Wilson pursued an unconventional route for funding. On November 16, 2010, the concepts for the TikTok and LunaTik iPod Nano watch conversion kits made their debut on Kickstarter, a website dedicated to small start ups trying to fund various projects. Wilson\u2019s designs made Kickstarter history, raising nearly a million dollars in small donations in the one month that the project was presented on the website. (Wilson\u2019s original goal was to raise $15,000.) The donations mainly came from individual consumers eager to purchase the products.\nThe museum is eager to add designs by National Design Award winners to the collection. TikTok and LunaTik speak to mass appeal and the idea of customization by the consumer. The iPod Nano watch conversion kits also complement the Apple products and traditional watches and time keeping devices in the museum\u2019s collection.\n[1] \u201cTikTok+LunaTik Multi-Touch Watch Kits by Scott Wilson + MINIMAL,\u201d Kickstarter, https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1104350651\/tiktok-lunatik-multi-touch-watch-kits",
