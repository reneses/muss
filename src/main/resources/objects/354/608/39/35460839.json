    "justification": "The Specimen poster, designed by Fanette Mellier, was featured in Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s 2012 exhibition, Graphic Design: Now in Production, and is depicted on the exhibition catalog\u2019s cover. Particularly engaging is the way the lower-right corner is folded back to reveal the poster\u2019s text, which advertises a series of exhibitions on editorial design held in 2008 in the town of Chaumont, France. \nTo the general public, the non-repetitive pattern of colorful geometric signs appears to resemble a diagram of a microchip. To the graphic designer, however, these symbols are immediately recognizable as printers\u2019 control marks. According to Mellier, she placed the text on the poster's reverse to avoid interrupting the tapestry-like design, but did so in a location that allows the viewer to easily access the information without folding the paper. The poster won second prize at the 2011 Chaumont International Poster and Graphic Design Festival.",
