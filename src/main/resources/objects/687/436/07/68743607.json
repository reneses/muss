    "justification": "This book is featured in Cooper Hewitt's 2014 exhibition, Passion for the Exotic, Lockwood de Forest, Frederic Church.  The publication was written by Lockwood de Forest during the years of his retirement from decorating, after moving permanently to Santa Barbara, California.  As, he says in the preface, he wrote the book for design teachers so they could deseminate the principles of Indian design to students to help them generate pattern through using certain design principles that he learned during his travels through India.   A number of the stencil prints in the book recall the patterns on the walls and woodwork in Cooper Hewitt's Teak Room, just as the photographs of Indian carved wood designs in the book are similar to the pattern of the sandstone jali also in the exhibition.",

He published this book of decorative patterns for teachers leading classes in which students learned about design and pattern through stenciling and tracing.
