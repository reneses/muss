    "label_text": "Buchsbaum was an architect and interior designer who worked for several architectural offices in New York before establishing his own firm in 1967. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and his Bachelor of Architecture Degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961. Buchsbaum became known for creating polished, high-tech interiors for loft apartments, and was a key figure in three significant, consecutive design phases: supergraphics, high-tech and postmodernism. This strong graphic pattern is a combination of his desire for polished, hi-tech interiors and his passion for large-scale graphics. The herringbone format, based on the classic herringbone design, is made contemporary by the use of primary colors, its large-scale, and the chopped or segmented execution of the design. The seemingly random placement of the yellow dots in select sections disrupts the regularity of the design, causing the eyes to meander in pursuit of the dots, which visually breaks up the strict geometry of the herringbone pattern.",
