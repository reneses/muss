    "description": "Digital print of a collage containing paper bits cut from hand-written sheet music. Each bit of paper contains a single notehead of whole and half notes with the musical stems removed.",
    "justification": "REM-04 is from the Remixed collection by Dutch collage artist Arthur Slenk (b. 1941) produced in 2013 and was selected from a group of eight patterns. The collection was inspired by two boxes of antique handwritten sheet music purchased by the artist. Slenk found a certain beauty in the handwritten musical scores and after studying the pages in depth he noticed certain recurring effects, such as ink stains, fingerprints, foxing, and the varying pressure of the pen on paper. He then started cutting out these different elements and storing them in assorted jars. The cut bits and pieces were then used to assemble large collages. He spent the next seven years creating 144 pages of collages constructed from these selected bits. One of the designs contained only musical terms, another was composed only of foxing and other forms of staining. This design incorporates the noteheads of full and half notes with the musical stems omitted. The hi-res photography and digital printing beautifully capture the raw edges and layering of the cut bits of the paper, creating a wonderful trompe l\u2019oeil effect. The slight variations in the shapes and coloring of the noteheads creates an over-all pattern, which when viewed from a distance somewhat resembles a leopard print. \n\nNLXL was founded in the Netherlands in 2010, and launched their first collection of Scrapwood Wallpaper by Piet Hein Eek in 2011, of which Cooper Hewitt has three examples in the permanent collection. Each year NLXL launches a new collection by a noted artist\/designer. \n\nAll three of these papers are unique and would bolster the collections of Dutch wallpapers as well as digital prints. The Studio Job papers also form a crossover with the museum's Product Design & Decorative Arts department as they are designers of furniture and lamps. The Slenk paper complements works of cut paper and collage in the Drawings, Prints & Graphic Design department.",
