    "justification": "This poster was designed to promote Cosmodrome, a contemplative light and sound space designed by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster and Jay-Jay Johanson. The poster was created to follow and announce the presence of the Cosmodrome wherever it was on view, in art spaces throughout the world.  It was one from an ongoing series of Art Posters designed by M\/M (Paris).  Each poster operates within the context of the art world \u201cas a medium and not as a decorative object.\u201d The series title refers to the tradition of selling reproductions in museums as art works affordable to the general public. Rather than represent a subject in a direct or subservient way, each poster develops the designers\u2019 intricate, idiosyncratic graphic language, demonstrating the poster\u2019s role as a \u201cperfomative medium.\u201d",
