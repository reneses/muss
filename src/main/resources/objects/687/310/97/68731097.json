    "description": "Distressed ground resembles a black wall with flaking white paint. The paint flakes are designed like a map, depicting Ginza, Japan.  The white dot represents the location of Ginza Graphic Gallery. Title of exhibition appears in black Helvetica text of varying sizes, stacked vertically.",
    "justification": "In 2012, Theseus Chan was invited by the Ginza Graphic Gallery in Tokyo, Japan to design a poster for a solo exhibition of his work. At this time, Chan was preparing to design and publish the twentieth volume of his magazine Werk, whose theme was \"The Extremities of the Printed Matter.\" The magazine is issued in a limited edition of 800 to 1000 copies, and each copy has a unique appearance, a reflection of the handcrafted nature of its production. Chan designed both the cover of the Werk volume and the exhibition poster at the same time. Both designs use Helvetica Neue font and feature the text in bold, black letters laid out across the space of the paper. For the poster, Chan added a representation behind the lettering of aGinza map, with the appearance of flaking paint and highlighting the precise location of the Ginza Graphic Gallery with a white speck. Once the posters had been printed, Chan\u2019s team at WORK crumpled each individual poster by hand, adding a physical dimension to the piece that suggests a distressed wall.",
