    "description": "Poster for Holy Other concert at S\u00fcdpol, March 2013. Large purple letters read \"Holy Other\" sideways in this vertical poster. The letters appear to wrap around a three-dimensional cylinder, so that the underside of each letter (black) is partially visible. Additional information about the concert is printed in white on these black back sections.",
    "justification": "These posters are part of Felix Pf\u00e4ffli\u2019s ongoing series for S\u00fcdpol, a multipurpose cultural center in Kriens, Switzerland. Before Pf\u00e4ffli began the series in 2010, each S\u00fcdpol poster was created by a different designer. Pf\u00e4ffli maintains this diversity in his series, treating each new commission as an experiment in type, texture, and space. Such a varied output befits the center, which Pf\u00e4ffli has described as \u201ca place with many different faces,\u201d and which incorporates a theater, a music school, multiple concert and exhibition spaces, a flea market, and a restaurant. Pf\u00e4ffli resists the standardized branding of many cultural institutions, and captures the unique character of the different performances and exhibitions he promotes, rather than presenting S\u00fcdpol as a cultural and aesthetic monolith.\nDespite their differences, these posters share a playful approach to typography. Working within the boundaries of an A3 format, Pf\u00e4ffli must devote most of his limited space to the name of an event. As such, he transforms the letters themselves into expressive, graphic elements. He considers how these letters occupy space, and interact with each other. Pf\u00e4ffli prints these posters using the small-scale Risograph technique suited to widespread distribution. Though inexpensively produced, the designs pop off the page with intriguing dimensionality.",

    "label_text": "Risography was invented in the 1980s in Japan as a low-cost alternative to photocopying. An image is cut into a master stencil, which is wrapped around an ink drum. The stencil and ink drum are replaced for each additional color. Risography became a popular medium among young designers and publishers in the early 21st century.",
