    "justification": "These posters are part of Felix Pf\u00e4ffli\u2019s ongoing series for S\u00fcdpol, a multipurpose cultural center in Kriens, Switzerland. Before Pf\u00e4ffli began the series in 2010, each S\u00fcdpol poster was created by a different designer. Pf\u00e4ffli maintains this diversity in his series, treating each new commission as an experiment in type, texture, and space. Such varied output befits the center, which Pf\u00e4ffli has described as \u201ca place with many different faces,\u201d and which incorporates a theater, a music school, multiple concert and exhibition spaces, a flea market, and a restaurant. Pf\u00e4ffli resists the standardized branding of many cultural institutions, and captures the unique character of the different performances and exhibitions he promotes, rather than presenting S\u00fcdpol as a cultural and aesthetic monolith.\nDespite their differences, these posters share a playful approach to typography. Working within the boundaries of an A3 format, Pf\u00e4ffli must devote most of his limited space to the name of an event. As such, he transforms the letters themselves into expressive, graphic elements. He considers how these letters occupy space, and interact with each other. Pf\u00e4ffli prints these posters using the small-scale Risograph technique suited to widespread distribution. Though inexpensively produced, Pf\u00e4ffli\u2019s designs pop off the page with intriguing dimensionality.",
