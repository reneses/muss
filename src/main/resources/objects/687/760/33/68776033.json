    "gallery_text": "According to H. LeBlanc, the cravat, a precursor to the necktie, \u201cshould not be considered as a mere ornament . . . [but, instead] a criterion by which the rank of the wearer may be at once distinguished, and is of itself \u2018a letter of introduction.\u2019\u201d The cravat is a short, wide band of fabric worn around the neck. It was worn as a fashion statement and became increasingly extravagant. For the more expensive cravats, the ends were trimmed with lace or embroidered and only the finest fabrics were used. Because it was imperative for the viewer to be able to \u201cread\u201d the patterns of the lace ends, tying the cravat became an important exercise. The American tied cravat was formed into a column (\u201cdestined to support a Corinthian capital\u201d) by a well-starched handkerchief and was called the \u201cIndependence\u201d by the fashionables of the New World. The list of styles details the intricacies of the variety of knot-tying but, importantly, the reader is warned that the greatest insult to a man is to seize him by the cravat and that the cravat should be loosened before the commencement of important business. Finally, the reader is reminded that if his cravat is elegantly formed even if his coat is not of the latest cut, he will be received with the \u201cmost distinguished marks of respect.\u201d",
