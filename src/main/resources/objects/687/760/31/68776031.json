    "gallery_text": "In 1850, the Specimens of Ornamental Art, Selected from the Best Models of the Classical Epochs was published in London.  It was classed then, and still is today, one of the finest printed books on the decorative arts that has ever been published. This work was important in providing accurate depictions of the decoration and ornament of Classical Rome, and those of Italian palaces, churches, and ancient buildings from the 13th through the 16th century. Artists and designers were inspired and influenced by the visual vocabulary of historical styles published by this and other 19th-century pattern books. A number of these publications were often seen as works of art in their own right. The printing and coloring processes were meticulous, time consuming and luxurious. Gr\u00fcner, an artist and engraver, was a confidante of Prince Albert and advised him on questions of art and design. In this capacity, he was closely involved in both the Great Exhibition of 1851 held at the Crystal Palace and, afterwards, in the creation of the South Kensington Museum (which later became the Victoria and Albert Museum). This sumptuous publication catered to the Prince's particular interest in Italian architecture, decoration, and ornament, and established classicism as his preferred style of architecture and design.",
