    "justification": "In the aftermath of World War II, a number of textile producers attempted to revitalize the industry by enlisting recognized personalities in art and architecture to design screen prints. \u201cPerhaps the most outstanding name collection is Stimulus Fabrics produced by Schiffer Prints,\u201d Alvin Lustig wrote in American Fabrics Magazine in 1951. \u201cThere was not a professional fabric designer in the group, but nevertheless a distinguished collection was established.\u201d[1]\nSchiffer invited six architects, designers and artists, including Salvador Dali, Ray Eames, George Nelson, Bernard Rudofsky, Abel Sorenson, and Edward Wormley, to design textiles for the collection, which debuted at the Architectural League of New York. The New York Times hailed it as \u201cUnquestionably the most brilliant single collection of all modern prints introduced since the war.\u201d[2]\nSome designs were to the trade only, and were available to architects and designers exclusively through L. Anton Maix. A different collection was sold to retail customers though department stores like W. and J. Sloane.  Still others found their way into moderately priced apparel. Forty different designs were created between 1949 and 1962, when Schiffer closed. \nIrving Harper, an employee of George Nelson Associates, designed Chips and six other prints that carry the George Nelson name.[3]  Dark shading gives a three-dimensional effect to scattered abstracted shapes.  The design was used on the cover of Schiffer\u2019s 1950 brochure promoting the Stimulus collection. There are currently four George Nelson pieces in the collection: a chair, two clocks and a storage system. \n \n\n\n\n\n[1] Alvin Lustig, \u201cModern Printed Fabrics,\u201d Design, January 1956, p. 29\n[2] New York Times, June 22, 1949.\n[3] Jeffrey Head, \u201cPattern Languages: The Artistic Legacy of Schiffer Prints,\u201d Modern, Summer 2014, p. 50",
