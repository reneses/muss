The Glass Center featured exhibitions on glass fabrication, types of glass, and the incredibly broad uses of glass. Its indisputable showpiece, however, was the Glass in the Home exhibition. Here, in the living room, dining room, kitchen, and bath, glass was used in every conceivable way: for the frame and legs of a piano, as a radio housing, as a bookcase, and in the curved frame of dining chairs.",
