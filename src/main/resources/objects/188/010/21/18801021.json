    "gallery_text": "This batik mural, over 8 feet high and 16 feet wide, depicts radio star Jessica Dragonette (1900\u20131980) at the center of the \u201cstory of radio\u2019s progress.\u201d Dragonette brought operetta and semi-classical music to over 60 million viewers weekly, and was one of radio\u2019s highest paid performers in the 1930s and 40s. The star is depicted atop a globe against a modern cityscape, with musical notes radiating in all directions, and is surrounded by images of theatrical figures and modern achievements, such as Richard Byrd\u2019s radio contact from the South Pole, depicted on the bottom left. Giulio Marconi, the Italian inventor celebrated for his pioneering work in long-distance radio transmission, is depicted in the top right, next to an abstract, stylized pattern resembling an electrical diagram. A celebration of radio\u2019s achievements as well as its potential, this mural signals the tremendous expansion and transformation of American information technology that would occur in the latter part of the century.",
