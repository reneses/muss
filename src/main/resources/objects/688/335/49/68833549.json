    "justification": "For his commemoration of the transition from summer to fall in his poster Herbstzeitlose (Autumn Crocus), G\u00f6tz Gramlich created both a digital animation and a screenprinted poster around the same design concept. In the animation, the letters peel away one by one from the surface to which they have been affixed, revealing their black undersides. Tucked into these corners are bits of information about the event. In the screenprinted version, the static image features each letter partially turned down, with faint black dots forming shadows behind the full letterforms.",
