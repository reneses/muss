    "justification": "On March 16, 2013, Cooper Hewitt hosted a demonstration of the process of a traditional form of Japanese stencil carving, katagami, and its use in the technique of resist-dyeing textiles, katazome, at the Cooper Hewitt Design Center in Harlem. This is one of the materials proposed for acquisition that documents the cutting and dyeing process used to produce a kimono that has also been offered as a gift to the museum.\nFor the demonstration, Isao Uchida and Masao Aida, together with Yuki Ikuta, Assistant Curator of the Mie Prefectural Art Museum in Japan, reproduced a sheet of katagami they had selected from Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s. Uchida carved the stencil of the two peacocks. For him, recreating the stencil was both an opportunity to trace the work of a master craftsman from nearly a century earlier and a chance to bring his own interpretation to the original depiction. The two-way orientation of the two peacocks is a traditional element of Japanese textile patterns. The design allows for a continuous length of fabric to be used to produce a kimono without any seams. The stencil design took three full days of labor to produce. Uchida said that he wanted to create the impression that the peacocks might take flight from the printed silk at any moment. \nAida (with the help of his apprentice, Airo Aida, who has trained for more than 10 years) showed visitors the elaborate process of transforming a white piece of silk into a vibrantly-colored and ornately-patterned textile. In addition to producing the repeating peacock pattern, Aida demonstrated his personal technique for producing a moir\u00e9 effect through dyeing silk. This technique is Aida\u2019s trademark and has its roots in a memory from his youth: Aida recalls being woken from a nap by his mother while he was still a teenager; when his mother informed him that it was time to get back to work, the young Aida opened his eyes to see the bright light filtering into the room between the slats of his bamboo shades, producing the delicate moir\u00e9 or rippled appearance. To this day, Aida\u2019s moir\u00e9-patterned scarves and kimonos are highly sought after throughout Japan. Those in attendance at the Design Center were captivated by Aida\u2019s story, as well as with his dyeing technique. At the time of proposed acquisition, the museum\u2019s collection includes one example of Aida\u2019s moir\u00e9-patterned scarves.",
