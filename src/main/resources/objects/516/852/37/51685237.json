    "justification": "This set of three lithographed panels was one of Alphonse Maria Mucha\u2019s designs for Lef\u00e8vre-Utile biscuit packaging.  Mucha had a long relationship with Lef\u00e8vre-Utile, a French biscuit company founded in Nantes in 1846.  Beginning in the 1880s, Lef\u00e8vre-Utile commissioned well-known artists to design their packaging and advertising.  In 1896, Mucha was commissioned to create posters for the company.  He was the first designer to use the company\u2019s initials, LU, as a decorative motif, which he did in his design for the company\u2019s 1897 calendar.  The abbreviation proved so popular that the company subsequently formally took up the moniker.  Around the turn of the century, Mucha was tasked with designing LU\u2019s packaging designs and a brand identity.  Mucha\u2019s designs reflect a particular sensitivity to the shape of the packaging and the pleasant natures of its contents\u2014Mucha\u2019s signature languorous women, along with the use of a consistent font and logo, reinforced LU\u2019s brand identity and transformed the package into its own publicity.",
