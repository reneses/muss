    "justification": "This cover for the musical score of Jules Massenet\u2019s Enchantement was designed by Eug\u00e8ne Samuel Grasset in 1892.  The song, composed by Massenet and set to a poem by Jules Ruelle, was featured in Massanet\u2019s opera Herodiade, a retelling of the biblical story of Salome based on Gustave Flaubert\u2019s short story written in 1877.  For his lyrical design, Grasset drew directly on the imagery described in Ruelle\u2019s poem, depicting an elegant enchantress with raised arms basking in the glow of the moon directly behind her.  With the wand in her right hand, the enchantress conjures two disembodied heads, which appear to materialize out of the lunar glow.  The cover for Enchantement is among Grasset\u2019s most overt uses of traditional Symbolist imagery.  It was included in his Salon des Cent exhibition in 1894, and appears to have served as direct inspiration for subsequent work by both Aubrey Beardsley and Alphonse Maria Mucha.",
