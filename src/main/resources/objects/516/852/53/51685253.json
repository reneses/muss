    "justification": "This print of three fashion designs by Sonia Delaunay originally appeared in the artist\u2019s 1925 folio Sonia Delaunay, Ses Peintures, Ses Objets, Ses Tissues Simultanes, Ses Modes. The folio featured designs for both textiles and clothing and was prefaced with writing by Tristan Tzara, Philippe Soupault, and Loys Delteil, all members of her avant-garde circle.  The book was published to coincide with the Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes held the same year in Paris, in which Delaunay\u2019s work was featured as part of the fashion designer Jacques Heim\u2019s presentation room.   The portfolio and her inclusion in the Paris Exposition marked a breakthrough in her career.  Delaunay worked simultaneously in a number of different media and viewed her designs for clothing and textiles as an extension of her artistic practice. This plate showcases her signature use of color to create form in three vibrant designs for women\u2019s clothing.",
