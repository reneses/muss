    "justification": "Paula Scher\u2019s work for The Public Theater began in 1994 when she was retained by the The Public\u2019s producer, George C. Wolfe, to design the organization\u2019s graphic identity. In seeking to provide a visual identity that responded to the theater\u2019s mission as an accessible community theater, Scher drew inspiration from the streets of New York City to create a series of graphics that responded to both the grid-structure of the streets and the urban language of graffiti. \nThe posters that Scher designed for The Public Theater have become iconic emblems\u2014not only of the plays that they advertised, but of the cultural moments in which they were produced. Scher\u2019s designs reference the pervasive social, economic and political issues of the time. The museum is perpetually interested in adding the work of National Design Award winners to the permanent collection.",
