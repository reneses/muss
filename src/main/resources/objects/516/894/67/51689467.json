    "justification": "Inspired by her work for The Public Theater, the choreographer and dancer Eliot Feld first approached Paula Scher about designing an identity for his dance company in 1997, when he decided to rename the company Ballet Tech. Scher designed an identity using a typographic family of slab serifs, setting the typography over photographer Lois Greenfield\u2019s images of the dancers. The following year, Scher reinvented the identity at Feld\u2019s request, staggering the letterforms to make them appear as though they were moving in space. Feld provided Scher with different images from his company for Scher to incorporate into her designs. \nIn this poster for Ballet Tech\u2019s 1999 season, Scher incorporates photographic images of four female dancers in identical elongated positions and sets them against a background of the lighting design plan used for the company's performances at the Joyce Theater in New York City.",
