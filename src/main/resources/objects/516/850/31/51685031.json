    "description": "Made by Additive Layer Manufacturing, in a strong green, of upright vase form in neo-classical shape like a tall Wedgwood or Sevres urn, with pierced crossed strands that create both surface and interior patterns",
    "justification": "Michael Eden, an important British studio ceramicist who spent over 20 years creating a variety of traditionally-fired ceramic forms\u2014predominantly in slip cast earthenware\u2014turned his attention to ceramic-inspired rapid-prototyped (3D-printed) objects in 2006. He was excited by the possibilities the process held for ceramic design beyond the cosntraints of conventional manufacturing. While at the Royal College of Art in London, he saw the potential for CAD drawing to realize designs that could not be made by hand and that could redefine the creative process. His exploration of new processes resulted in a piece called The Wedgwoodn\u2019t Tureen.\nThe Wedgwoodn\u2019t Tureen, which draws a correlation between the future of ceramic design and Josiah Wedgwood\u2019s role at a pivotal moment in the first wave of industrialized ceramic manufacturing in the late 18th century, is a demonstration of rapid prototyping\u2019s circumvention of the material and technical limitations of ceramics. It is from the success of this initial piece that Tall Green Bloom developed. Eden describes these new works as the beginning of \u201ca new ceramic language... where the pre-industrial craft meets post-industrial manufacturing.\u201d[1]\nTall Green Bloom, created using additive manufacturing (3D printing), is part of a series based on iconic ceramic objects from the first industrial revolution; Eden intentionally creates complex structures in bright colors that would be impossible to produce with traditional ceramic techniques and materials. Eden's use of 3D-printing technology demonstrates a strong, clear voice speaking to the world in the new ceramic language of his own invention. \n\n[1] Michael Eden, \u201cThings Machines Have Made,\u201d Craft Research 3, no. 1 (2012), doi: 10.1386\/crre.3.1.127_7",
