    "gallery_text": "This 1924 issue of the \u201cGazette du Bon Ton\u201d illustrates a fanciful ballroom costume created by Paul Poiret, a leading French fashion designer during the first two decades of the 20th century. The bold, dramatic, whimsical, layered geometric form, resembling lampshades, is the distinctive element of this Art Deco period gown.  The Gazette du Bon Ton, a leading fashion magazine in Paris and in Europe (1912 to 1925), was founded by Lucien Vogel, featured the fashions of Poiret, among others. The Gazette was a lavish magazine which chronicled contemporary developments in fashion, lifestyle, and beauty as well as advancing fashion illustration to a new level of refinement and sophistication. Each issue featured ten full-page fashion plates which were hand-colored pochoir prints produced by notable artists and illustrators.  One such artist, A. \u00c9. Marty (1882-1974), was one of only four artists to contribute to every year of La Gazette du Bon Ton.  Marty also had illustrations published in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, among others.",
