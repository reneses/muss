    "justification": "When world-renowned architect David Adjaye was invited to curate an exhibition for the Cooper Hewitt\u2019s Selects series, he quickly chose to focus on the museum\u2019s little-known collection of West African textiles, including works from Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Mali. Having devoted eleven years to an in-depth study of the architecture of the African continent, Adjaye found that a region\u2019s textile and craft traditions could present solutions for larger-scale design concerns. \u201cThese techniques can be\u2026inspirational for modern architectural initiatives seeking to provide a more sustainable and culturally relevant built environment,\u201d he said.\nGiven his interest in combining traditional African aesthetics with a modern design sensibility, the museum initiated a collaboration between Adjaye and Knoll Textiles to produce a line of fabrics inspired by the textiles in the exhibition. The resulting collection of six upholsteries, two drapery sheers and one wallcovering premiered at NeoCon in June 2015, where it won both the Best of Neocon and the Neocon Gold awards, and will launch in September, 2015. A portion of the proceeds from sales of these products will support the museum\u2019s textile acquisitions. \nCombining Adjaye\u2019s unique perspective on abstract geometric pattern systems with Knoll Creative Director Dorothy Cosonas\u2019s deep knowledge of woven and print techniques, the collection presents an exceptionally rich and varied range of patterns and textures.  Each textile is named for an African city, and reflects Adjaye\u2019s personal love of African geography, nature and culture, as well as his deep respect for the museum\u2019s collection. \"I was very inspired by the wide array of geometry, textures and forms I found in museum's collection of African textiles,\" he said. \"It struck me that together they really told the story of the diversity of these regional traditions of craftsmanship.\"",
