    "description": "Linen border with silk fringe on one long edge, completely covered with deflected element embroidery in yellow silk. The pattern areas are reserved in the linen ground fabric, along with one long rectangle reserved as if for an inscription. Paired confronted cherubs alternate with interlocking branches terminating in human heads at both ends. All motifs are outined in green silk; black beads for eyes; red beads as centers of rosettes.",

    "gallery_text": "This unique fragment was collected by the Hewitt sisters before the founding of the Museum. It is most likely a border from a domestic or ecclesiastical textile made in Sicily \u2013 a region known for its white-on-white embroidery. It has a curious pattern of interlocking, curved branches that terminate on the top and bottom with the head of a grotesque figure. These alternate with confronted cupids that rise from slender plant forms. Rosettes are interspersed throughout the pattern. At the bottom is a rectangular banner \u2013 these were either inscribed or left blank. A major portion of the embroidery fills the background leaving the pattern in the plain weave fabric. The monochromatic nature of the piece is subtly enhanced by the use of colored glass beads and the subtle green double running stitches that outline the pattern.",
