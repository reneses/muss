As a shield that hides more than the face, this artifact extends the body\u2019s capability to engage with life-threatening situations and has one overriding purpose: to keep the wearer alive. Made of Kevlar\u00ae, it is part of the armor worn by law-enforcement officers during raids or when apprehending snipers. Its design is a visual expression of its purpose: with the individual totally effaced, its sinister appearance ups the ante of confrontation and intimidation. Con\u00accealing all but the eyes, it gives the wearer an immediate advantage, serving to unnerve and frighten the suspect into compliance.",
