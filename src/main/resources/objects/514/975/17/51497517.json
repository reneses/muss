Issey Miyake, a series of garments made from a single piece of folded cloth. \u201cRegeneration\u201d and \u201crecycling\u201d refer to both the recycled PET products used to make the polyester fabric for the garments and to the design\u2019s evolution from previous projects: his 1998 A-POC (A Piece of Cloth), represented in the museum\u2019s collection, and the legendary Pleats Please, developed by Miyake since 1988.\nMiyake developed 132 5. with Reality Lab, a research and development team led by Miyake and staff members who wanted to explore the future of making things\u2014from clothing to industrial products. According to Miyake, \u201c132 5. begins with one piece of cloth manipulated through three-dimensional molding that can be returned to a two-dimensional plane and creates a fifth dimension when the garment is worn and comes to life.\u201d The shapes were conceived in collaboration with computer scientist, Jun Mitani, a researcher of mathematical methods for creating three-dimensional structures through paper folding.\n132 5. has 10 basic patterns, or folded forms; these become blouses, skirts, pants, and dresses when the top of the folded square is pulled upwards. Variations of the garments are created by adjusting the size, combination of shapes, and the cut of the pattern.\nMiyake\u2019s philosophy has always been about keeping clothes relevant and celebrating the process by which clothes are made. Often, this process pushes the technological envelope for textile mills. At the heart of all his projects, however, is an incorporation of centuries-old textile traditions from Japan or other parts of the world. This is why Miyake\u2019s works transcend fashion and are so appropriate for Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s textile collection, which strives to include the most innovative examples of design.",
