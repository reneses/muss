    "justification": "This object is part of an identity program designed by Maureen Mooren for Marres, Centre for Contemporary Culture in Maastricht, Netherlands. Since Marres organizes both on-site and off-site exhibitions and projects, Mooren decided the identity should be something that would express the experimental nature of the institution and its open curatorial voice. A traditional static logo would not suffice. \nThe resulting logo has no standard elements, except the repetition of the letter M. \u201cIt serves as an identity, says Mooren, \u201cpartly because of the lack of a logo.\u201d Her identity program for Marres relies on a loose, somewhat random appearance of typographical elements. Mooren\u2019s approach to identity design reflects the contemporary issues of eclecticism and confusion resulting from a society overloaded with information.",
