    "justification": "Feather Flurries was designed in 1993 by Reiko Sudo, one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers and co-founder of Nuno Corporation. The textile represents the extraordinary handwork that still inspires Sudo and other designers at Nuno. During the weaving process, individual feathers are inserted by hand into the woven, rectangular pockets of silk organdy. The frosted moir\u00e9 of the organdy gives the feathers a feeling of drifting in air. Feather Flurries was included in the exhibition, Structure and Surface: Contemporary Japanese Textiles, organized by The Museum of Modern Art and The Saint Louis Art Museum in 1998.\nThis work along with the other Japanese textiles acquired over the past several years has begun to establish a strong core of contemporary textiles, an area specifically targeted for acquisition. These textiles reflect some of the best work from the last 20 years and through their study will add to an understanding of not only current Japanese technology but also long-standing textile traditions in Japan.",
