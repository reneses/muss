    "justification": "Textile designer Elizabeth Whelan has played a critical role in the development of ergonomic task chair design. Her sleekly beautiful mesh fabrics for Humanscale are integral to the structure and function of the chairs for which they were designed. \nWhelan met designer and ergonomics engineer Niels Diffrient in 2002, when she was contracted to design 4-way stretch upholstery fabrics for Humanscale\u2019s Freedom Chair. But Diffrient already had a different kind of ergonomic chair in mind -- one with an upholstered seat and a mesh back -- which would become the Liberty Chair. Being part of the design team from the very beginning made this a different kind of textile design commission: \u201cI had time to learn about what the chair required,\u201d Whelan says. \u201cI could develop a textile to meet those requirements and the demands of production.\u201d   In her studio in Manhattan, Whelan experimented on hand looms with a wide variety of yarns and weave structures before settling on a mesh of monofilament and metallic yarns. In the Liberty Chair, the mesh seat back is a 3-panel construction with curved seams -- a solution from the world of tailoring -- to provide a curved surface that conforms to the shape of the back. \nLuminesce Mesh was introduced at NeoCon in 2004, where it won the Best of NeoCon Gold, as well as a Design Distinction award from I.D. Magazine the following year. The chair was also exhibited in Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s National Design Triennial, Design Life Now, in 2006, and was acquired by the Museum in 2008.",
