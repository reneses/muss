    "description": "Small-scale pattern of irregular circle motifs on a luster ground. The design is composed of applied ground walnut shells in a tan color on a slightly irridescent lighter tan background.",
    "justification": "To help show a broader range of Carnegie Fabrics production I am also presenting \"Acorn\", which is not a Xorel fabric, and is strictly available as a wallcovering, but still follows in the company\u2019s mission to produce attractive wallcoverings that are sustainable. The slight luster on the paper along with the surface texture of the design are quite elegant and create a subtle overall pattern. This design is created using 100% ground walnut shells while the backing is made from 70% recycled paper content. This is a rather high percentage as most wallcoverings containing recycled paper average around 30-60% recycled content.\n\nBoth Xorel and BioBased Xorel are innovative improvements to the field of commercial wallcoverings, and collecting both shows the evolution of this product. When Xorel was introduced it was one of the few healthier alternatives to vinyl. \"Acorn\" shows that waste materials can be re-used to beautiful effect. \n\nThe Museum has collected wallcoverings showing innovative improvements in sanitary and durability concerns for many years, including: intaglio-printed wallpapers developed in the early 1870s that were the first wipeable wallpapers; Lincrusta-Walton, introduced in 1877 was the first washable, nearly indestructible wallcovering; Sanitas, an oil-impregnated fabric wallcovering introduced in 1903 was washable and recommended for high traffic areas. In 1904 the Campbell Wall Paper Company patented an antiseptic wallpaper which prevented the absorption of bacteria. Innovations in sustainability\/responsible design are on the department wishlist.",
